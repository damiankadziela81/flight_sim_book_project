# Falcon 3.0
## Review
### Falcon 3.0
When Falcon 3.0 hit the stores at the end of 1991, the series already had a good reputation in the world of computer flight simulations. It had two successful releases plus mission disks on the Amiga, Atari ST, and IBM-compatible PCs. The biggest criticisms of the predecessors were the too-small game world and the lack of dynamism in the missions.

In their April 1992 issue, Computer Gaming World described the goals for Falcon 3.0 by the design team at Sphere Inc. as follows:
an accurate flight model of the F-16 Fighting Falcon
“state of the art” graphics
* a realistic set of weapons for air-to-ground and air-to-air missions
* a game world populated with competent and challenging enemies and allies
* a game world so large and extensive that players would have an engaging experience and want to return to the simulation repeatedly
* a comprehensive manual that describes all concepts, backgrounds, and the operation of the simulation

With the fulfillment of these goals, Falcon 3.0 can undoubtedly be considered a milestone in the history of flight simulations from today’s perspective. Many of the features that Falcon 3.0 introduced for the first time became standard in the following years. This starts with a thick manual that leaves no questions unanswered, continues with extensive training missions (Redflag in Nevada), and ends with a dynamic campaign in one of the three conflict zones (Kuwait, Panama, Israel).
The actual simulation and campaign system are complemented by squadron management. The simulation keeps track of the successes, failures, and skills of all pilots in a squadron. Training and real missions improve the pilots’ skills. Injured comrades are out of action for a few days. Missions are no longer flown alone but with up to seven wingmen. Commands can be given to the wingmen via keyboard shortcuts, and they respond or comment on the events with digitized voice samples (“Fox Two”, “Apex Inbound!”).

### Addons
#### Operation Fighting Tiger
In addition to a series of bug fixes, the add-on Operation Fighting Tiger introduces three new conflict zones: Japan/Kuril Islands, Korea, and Pakistan/India. The new scenarios feature a range of new ground and air units, as well as new weaponry suitable for the three new conflicts.
In the Japan scenario, players can now also fly the Japanese-developed F-16 FS-X.

#### MiG-29: Deadly Adversary of Falcon 3.0
The first aircraft addon brings the Russian fighter MiG-29 into the world of Falcon. In addition to a new intro and a colorfully and visually adapted UI, the MiG-29 is the main focus. The cockpit, weapon systems, and flight characteristics differ significantly from what you are used to with the F-16. Even the digitized voice samples now have a Russian accent.

#### Hornet: Naval Strike Fighter
With the F/A-18 Hornet and the Balkans, Falcon receives a new aircraft and a completely new scenario (Bosnia and Herzegovina) in the latest addon. The Hornet can be flown for the U.S. Navy and the Marine Corps. As expected for the F-18, it can now also operate from an aircraft carrier during missions.

#### Avenger A-10 (not released)
After the F-16, the A-10 was supposed to be the second aircraft in the “Electronic Battlefield Series” with Avenger. However, since the A-10 operates much closer to the ground compared to the F-16, there were significant issues with rendering the landscape using the hardware available at the time. Today, only a few screenshots and the design of the packaging cover have been preserved.

## Quotes and Triva
* "Falcon 3.0 is not for the faint of heart, weak of system arcade gamer. Its very design boldly says, 'This is the future of flight simulation, keep up or shut up!' - Doug Fick, Computer Gaming World, April 1992 -
* In old promotional material, “Operation Fighting Tiger” was still referred to as “Operation Flying Tiger” and mentioned the Philippines as the new area of operation
* “Computers with a mathematical coprocessor used a better flight model.”
