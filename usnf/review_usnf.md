### US Navy Fighters
US Navy Fighters was released by Electronic Arts in 1994 for DOS. Designed by Brent Iverson - known from his previous flight sim games released under EA - LHX Attack Chopper and Chuck Yeager's Air Combat, US Navy Fighters was marketed as "The FIRST title in EA's new Air Combat Series of CD-ROM flight simulations". And it felt like the first, truly modern product, fully utilizing capabilities of the newly introduced CD-ROM media, with great high resolution graphics, superb sound effects, music complemented by full motion videos.

As the title suggests we will fly for the Navy - there are six flyable aircraft - F/A-18D Hornet, F-14B Tomcat, A-7 Corsair, F-22N Lighting II (navalized version), Su-33 Flanker and F-104 Starfighter. The last entry may leave you baffled - I guess it was added as a novelty, since F-104 isn't available in the campaign, only in single missions. Each aircraft feels unique, with differences in performance, loadouts and avionics sophistication (max radar range for RWS/TWS, built in IR seeker etc.). During the campaign you will need to keep your eye on the reserves - aircraft and weapons have limited stocks (except old A-7s which apparently the Navy have unlimited amounts of), so you better bring those aircraft home - even damaged birds can be repaired. After each mission you are alloted with 50 service hours to make repairs to your aircraft, keep in mind that even undamaged birds need some maintenance time after each flight. Note that wingman aircraft and weapons do not count into this stock. So a good tactic during the campaign is to use up your wingmen weapons first whenever possible, more on that later.

The most controversial part of this game regarding current world events will obviously be its campaign setting. It depicts the Russian invasion of Ukraine that takes place in 1997 (remember that the game was released in 1994) after hard-liners regain control in Russia. The US sends USS Eisenhower to Black Sea to intervene. Overall, the campaign is linear and consists of 50 canned missions. Each mission is unique and presents new challenges each time. For each sortie you are free to choose your aircraft and loadout, but it's generally best to stick with recommendations stated in the briefing. The game models time-of-day and different weather types, you can find yourself taking off during day time and coming back at night for your carrier landing. Weather is not dynamic though, so the current state will last throughout the mission. During your campaign playthrough you are allowed to fail 5 missions, after which you will be relegated to flying the desk. The campaign can also end if your pilot dies, but you can retry any failed mission if you want to stick out til the end. Each mission is complemented with few FMV cutscenes, sparse campaign status update, briefing and after mission pilot banter in the briefing room will increase your immersion during your campaign playthrough. One important thing regarding the campaign - in some missions you will NEED your wingman to complete them, since you alone don't carry enough weapons to fulfil the objective yourself. Pro-gamers can win some missions without firing a single shot - they delegate the task to their wingman, it works because the AI is really capable. This also saves your weapon stock, every missile you bring back goes back to the inventory, so running out of certain weapons near the end of campaign is less likely to happen.

Beside the campaign, you can fly single missions - there are 14 training missions and 36 single missions that are quite familiar if you have flown the campaign already. You can also create your own scenarios with Create Quick Mission and Create Pro Mission options, the former is similar to the feature known from Chuck Yeager's Air Combat, the latter is a full blown mission editor you can use to build as complex missions as those used in the campaign.

Speaking of CYAC, the flight model feels like it's an evolution of the one used in Yeager. You can even bring up the similar "Flight Envelope" window with 'Shift-1' that depicts your aircraft speed vs. altitude graph with available Gs, with the ability to compare it to your target to visualize your aircraft strength (or your opponent weakness) and find that sweet spot corner-velocity for optimum dogfighting performance. Something new in the flight model is the ability to enter a flat spin, though without using the rudder intentionally it's practically impossible. The F-104 is basically unrecoverable after entering the spin, so the only option is to ride that silk elevator.

Damage modelling also got an improvement - after sustaining damage you can experience component failure, in some cases cascading - so an oil leak can lead to an engine fire and fairy explosion. Interestingly possible fluid leaks consist of fuel (engine goes dead), oil (engine goes hot and then boom), hydraulics (no steering/brakes/gear) and your own blood (if a pilot gets hit he will bleed to death after some time). If you manage to land before the catastrophic failure, your aircraft is deemed repairable, even if the damage is 100%, though it will take 100 hours to fix. One thing I never seen in any other flight sim is the possibility of a cat failure during launch - in such cases your aircraft is lost to sea and if you're not fast enough to eject, your pilot is dead too.

The pilot AI in this game is phenomenal - paired with great wingman control and robust view system including smoothly scrolling cockpit padlock view, external tactical views to your target or incoming missiles turns tactical engagements into adrenaline fueled air spectacles. Generally maintaining situational awareness in this game is pretty easy. Enemy aircraft depending on their experience will apply proper BFM depending on the situation, you can even take a peek at what they are currently up to in the "Target Window" with their currently executed maneuver listed as their status. Friendly wingman and your RIO will shout dozens of voice lines at you during combat, few of them citing the classics like "Do some of that pilot s---" or completely new ones like "I'm getting a hard on"... anyway taking out that ground target with the RIO yelling "Boom! Oh yeah!" feels oddly satisfying. In the music department things looked bright as well. The score was prepared by The Fat Man and Team Fat, so no surprise here - really atmospheric pieces that really enhance your flying experience. The music during missions is dynamic, similarly to Wing Commander or Strike Commander, depending on the situation different themes are played - it's not as sophisticated system as Lucas Arts iMUSE where there were dynamic transitions between the themes, but it's getting the job done.

On the bad side, the Yeager game engine legacy introduced the "problem" with the scale of objects in the game. The size to speed relationship was pretty jarring in USNF - the objects were oversized compared to their low apparent speed, in CYAC where you only had 320x200 graphics mode available it wasn't an issue and more of a conscious choice - otherwise you would be shooting to 3 pixels all the time. Speaking about 3d objects - most aircraft models in USNF bear high resemblance to the ones from Strike Commander from Origin released in 1993. EA bought out Origin in 1992 and most likely let the USNF team use the 3d models from SC. Even the concept of pop-up windows is the same as in Strike Commander, though you could argue that CYAC did it first. But when CYAC modelled the whole cockpit with instruments, USNF followed the route SC had chosen - it displayed only the upper part of the cockpit with the HUD as a main instrument, with additional information displayed on maximum 4 pop-up windows in the corners. One thing that impressed me at the time was the working mirrors on the canopy rail. Oddly one useful thing from CYAC didn't make the cut in USNF - the video recorder feature. It was really well done and sadly missed in USNF. THe game also didn't feature any multiplayer modes, but that was rectified later with Jane's USNF'97.

This game sparked the whole series of expansions and standalone spin-offs, culminating with Jane's Fighters Anthology released in 1997, uniting all into one wholesome package - "The Mother of All Flight Sims" slapped on the back of the box was no exaggeration.

### Addons / Patches
#### 1.1 Patch
This patch adds support for the CH Flightstick Pro and the Forte VFX1 helmet. It also fixes some difficulties with sound, as well as issues with installing and running the game on machines with more than 16 MB of RAM.

#### U.S. Navy Fighters Expansion Disk: Marine Fighters
Required the base game. It added new flyable aircraft (AV-8B Harrier II, Sea Harrier, Yak-141 Freestyle and AC-130 Spectre), new Wasp class amphibious ship and new 35-mission campaign set on a new map - Kuril Islands. It also introduced many bug fixes as well as new features - like better frame rate, ability to terrain mask, new effects like low level buffet and turbulence, detailed statistics after each mission and summary of Tour of Duty with kills, decorations etc.

#### US Navy Fighters Gold
This was released in 1995 and combined USNF with Marine Fighters expansion.

### 3rd party tools and addons
Plenty of player created missions were released thanks to inclusion of the powerful Pro Mission Creator. Users added more aircraft, weapons, vehicles etc. by the means of custom libraries.

## Quotes and Triva
* The game required 486 running at 25 MHz with 4MB RAM to run, though 486@66MHz with 8MB RAM was recommended. I played it originally on Pentium 75MHz with 16MB RAM and in 640x480 resolution I still had to disable some texturing options to be able to play it at a reasonable framerate.
* In 1997 it was released for PlayStation
* There were few pretty funny easter eggs hidden in the game - like the ability to make your RIO loose his dinner by flying with oscillating G-force between negative and positive G, or in Marine Fighters Kuril campaign you could encounter a strange creature - Atomic Moth, which you could actually fly yourself and it had a comedic entry in the Reference section (you had to use cheat to access it).
* Computer Gaming World praised it for superb graphics, sound and great AI, with cons being compromises in the flight model, no FlightStick Pro support and high requirements for best detail.
* It was one of the first DOS games (if not the first) that supported resolutions up to 1024x768, though at the time there was no personal computer that could run it with all the graphical bells and whistles at that resolution at playable framerate.
