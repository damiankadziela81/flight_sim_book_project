### US Navy Fighters


### Addons / Patches
#### 1.1 Patch
This patch adds support for the CH Flightstick Pro and the Forte VFX1 helmet. It also fixes some difficulties with sound, as well as issues with installing and running the game on machines with more than 16 MB of RAM.

#### U.S. Navy Fighters Expansion Disk: Marine Fighters
Required the base game. It added new flyable aircraft (AV-8B Harrier II, Sea Harrier, Yak-141 Freestyle and AC-130 Spectre), new Wasp class amphibious ship and new 35-mission campaign set on a new map - Kuril Islands. It also introduced many bug fixes as well as new featrues - like better frame rate, ability to terrain mask, new effects like low level buffet and turbulence, detailed statistics after each mission and summary of Tour of Duty with kills, decorations etc.

#### US Navy Fighters Gold
This was released in 1995 and combined USNF with Marine Fighters expansion.

### 3rd party tools and addons

## Quotes and Triva
* There were few pretty funny easter eggs hidden in the game - like the ability to make your RIO loose his dinner by flying with oscilating G-force between negative and positice G, or in Marine Fighters Kuril campaign you could encounter a strange creature - Atomic Moth, which you could actualy fly yourself and it had a comedic entry in the Reference section (you had to use cheat to access it)
