# F/A-18 Interceptor
## Review

F/A-18 Interceptor was an Amiga exclusive, released in 1988 by Electronic Arts and developed by Intellisoft. The premise was simple - you fly an F/A-18 Hornet or F-16 Falcon while defending the US west coast from Soviet Union.

The game came on one 3.5" floppy disk and featured a true 3d environment which on stock Amiga 500 ran decently fast for the time. The game modelled the San Francisco Bay Area with many points of interest present - like Golden Gate Bridge, Alcatraz Island, several buildings in DownTown San Francisco and more. Several airports were usable - San Francisco International, Oakland, Moffett as well as USS Enterprise off the coast. There were several game modes present - you could do a simple Free Flight sightseeing the scenery, take part in the training - learn basic fighter maneuvers from an AI controlled F-16 or take part in combat missions. Though for the last option first you had to pass your carrier quals - you had to prove that you could safely land on the carrier.

The meat of the game - the six (yes, only six) available missions would unlock sequentially after you completed the previous one. Your progress would be saved and you could analyze your statistics in your pilot's log. The missions were diverse fortunately, and were somewhat randomized - for example, when tasked with intercepting a cruise missile, the spot it originated from wasn't the same each time you flew the mission. The objectives ranged from intercepting unknown contacts or cruise missiles, escorting Air Force One, diverting back (or shooting down) stolen F-16s, providing aid for downed airmen (S&R supply drop). And of course the infamous "Sub Mission" with the misleading briefing that let you believe that your task was to sink it. It wasn't possible, since you had only A/A weapons available to you. To finish this mission all you had to do was to down all the enemy aircraft that were scrambled from that sub/carrier.

The flight model was questionable - most notably the way it models turning is not really realistic - your aircraft will change direction even with slightest bank without pulling back on the stick. It makes dogfighting a bit awkward, but nevertheless it's functional. The stalls are modelled and carrier landings can feel pretty realistic. There are many subtle nuances - like when you break the sound barrier you will get both visual and audio feedback. The most amazing aspect though is the world scale representation. I made some calculations and comparisons and I can confirm that the map scale is 1:1 to the real world. I calculated the time it would take to travel from specific places in the real world (time = speed / distance) and double checked that while performing flights with the same parameters in MSFS2020 and it was nearly perfect. Note when you play this game on faster Amiga (like A1200) the game will run faster, it was clearly designed for that specific 7MHz clocked 68000 Motorola CPU.

A lot of time was spent in the sound department. While the base effects were created by Dave Warhol, to minimize the potential of irritation of the repetitive engine noise for example, Bob Dinnerman altered the base engine sound parameters (pitch, rumble and volume) with the throttle and stick actions. It added another layer of feedback for the player on how the aircraft 'felt'. Bob in his interview also confessed that the avionics tonal effects were derived from the Top Gun film. And you can tell, in fact the game's music theme was clearly inspired by the Top Gun Anthem - though to hear it you need that 512 KB memory expansion fitted in your Amiga 500. It's not an exaggeration to say the soundscape is holding up really well even today - 36 years after original release!

## Quotes & Trivia
* "The widely known ability to select [0] for the "Free Flight, No Enemy Confrontation", which places your jet on the ground without a runway was originally intended to be another starting location (at Edwards Air Force Base) but I didn?t have enough time to finish it. Leaving the ability to take off from there in the game was, I believe, not intentional but... no harm done." - Bob Dinnerman.
* During the last mission you could land on the enemy carrier/sub to re-arm and re-fuel, take off and continue your mission.
* As long as your gear was down and your vertical speed was low enough - your landing was deemed successful, even if your orientation was upside down - the lack of the check of your orientation in the code continued later into later Bob Dinnerman's games in the series - up to Jet Fighter IV released in 2000.
* The game featured external views of the aircraft (10 angles) as well as tower view, really uncommon at the time.
* In 1988, PC players got a port of this game in form of Jet Fighter: The Adventure - it added F-14 Tomcat, ground munitions in form of dumb bombs (no CCIP HUD delivery mode though) and the map was extended south to include Los Angeles with 2 additional airfports. The amount of missions was also radically increased to 40. The series continued, Bob Dinnerman helmed four releases, from fifth and onwards the game was developed by different studio.
