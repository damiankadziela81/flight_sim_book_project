# Fighter Pilot
In 1982, David Marshall developed a simulator for the American interceptor F-15 in his spare time on a ZX81 with just 1KB of memory(!). At that time, he was working as a Flight Systems Engineer at a British Ministry of Defence facility after completing his engineering studies. Shortly thereafter, he resigned along with his colleague Rod Swift, and the two founded their own company: Digital Integration Ltd.

The first game, Night Gunner, was initially released for the ZX81, but soon after, a technically improved version for the ZX Spectrum followed. Night Gunner places the player in the roles of both a gunner and a bombardier in a British Lancaster bomber. The gunner must shoot down enemy fighters, and the bombardier ensures that the bombs hit their targets. However, the game is not yet a true flight simulation but rather an arcade-style shoot 'em up game with a World War II background.

After the success of Night Gunner, Marshall revisited Fighter Pilot and initially ported the concept to the ZX Spectrum. Flight simulators were not yet a widespread genre (especially in the UK with its predominant Sinclair computers). In 1983, the only competing product on the Spectrum was Flight Simulation by Psion Software. Later, ports for the Amstrad CPC, the Commodore 64, and the Atari 8-bit home computers followed. The latter two versions were distributed in the USA by Epyx under the name Jet Combat Simulator.

Despite its sparse graphics, Fighter Pilot remained in the British game charts for months. What distinguished Fighter Pilot was an impressive set of input controls for thrust, elevator, aileron, and rudder controls for its time. The implementation of the cockpit instruments was also convincing.
A series of training flights were available, where landings could be practiced under different weather and visibility conditions. 
For those who had enough of the training flights, they could also engage in air combat. However, only close combat was flown here, meaning there was only the onboard cannon as the weapon of choice and no missiles. Ground targets were not attacked anyway, but Fighter Pilot did not simulate the F-15E Strike Eagle but rather the F-15C in the form of a pure interceptor.
