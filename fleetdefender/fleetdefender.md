### Fleet Defender

Fleet Defender developed and released by Microprose for the PC market in 1994 was the first true attempt at creating a serious representation of F-14 Tomcat in a computer game. As with F-15 Strike Eagle 3 released two years prior, the subject matter experts (SMEs) were utilized while developing the new game.

Built on improved engine used in Microprose's previous flight sims, Fleet Defender looked phenomenal - with moody textured sky, varied time of day and weather, 3d rolling terrain which was also fully textured, the game needed a fast 486DX CPU running at at least 40MHz at the time. Player's aircraft was meticulously crafted with really detailed 3d mesh and fully textured - each squadron had their own insignia! Other aircraft had simpler 3d models, but were still fully textured. Another object that had to retain high detail was obviously the carrier - your home amidst the cold ocean. There were 3 variants of the carrier you could select in the difficulty option - Forrestal class, Kitty Hawk class and the biggest - Nimitz class.

The base game lets you fly in Oceana to hone your skills in multiple training scenarios, or take it seriously and fly in 6 campaigns - 3 in North Cape and 3 in Mediterranean. Later Scenario expansion added 2 more war zones - India/Pakistan and Korean Peninsula, along with new Pacific based squadrons. Campaigns are not dynamic, but the mission parameters are randomized (time, weather, chance of appearing of certain units) and missions are arranged logically into a "mission tree" - concept known from Wing Commander games. So subsequent playthroughs of the same campaign can yield completely different results.

But you weren't fighting alone - the first thing that distinguished Fleet Defender from previous Stealth Fighters and Strike Eagles was that you were indeed a small cog in a big war machine, you no longer fought alone. In every mission there were dozens of aircraft in the air - friendly F-14s on CAP, E-2 Hawkeye providing responses for picture requests as well as data-link for your mighty AWG-9, depending on the mission there would be huge strike packages consisting of Intruders and Hornets or BUFFs from USAF flying long range bombing runs. Each time anybody goes into the drink the SAR helo would be scrambled from the carrier. You could also request assistance from the Ready-5 flight if it was available, otherwise other F-14s would be vectored to your position if possible. Additionally to the enemy aircraft, there was a possibility to meet neutral aircraft in the air, even civilian airliners - thankfully F-14 was equipped with powerful TCS (Tactical Camera System) that could help you recognize a big civilian airliner that did not respond to your IFF query. Overall you could have nearly 100 aircraft flying at the same time in a theatre. It was impressive, but also because of this, the multiplayer feature known from previous F-15 Strike Eagle 3, where you could fly as pilot/wingman or even pilot/RIO was cut - too much data would have to be synchronized between the clients.

Speaking of wingman - Fleet Defender featured a similar squadron management system known from Falcon 3.0 - there were 2 Tomcat squadrons based on the carrier - each had unique crews with their stats, callsign, name etc. Each could perish, but if you take care of them they would gain experience and would end up really helpful in future missions and campaigns. You could really build a connection to these artificial entities - I still remember Susan "COOL" Bent saving my butt in one of the missions where I got damaged during a dog fight and she cleared my six when I was trying to bug out. In fact friendly AI is crucial to succeeding in Fleet Defender - most missions are built in a way where the player is there only to "tip the scale", most heavy work is done by other flights, which is brilliant.

We didn't talk yet about the star of the show - the mighty F-14 Tomcat. In Fleet Defender Microprose depicted the B variant with improved engines. Because it's a two seater, you can switch between the pilot and RIO (Radar Intercept Officer) seats. As with most Microprose flight sims you could tailor your experience by adjusting a plethora of difficulty settings. In most realistic setup the avionics are represented true to life, considering the time when the game came out obviously. Most AWG-9 radar modes are depicted - Pulse-Doppler Search, Range While Search, Track While Scan - both Auto and Manual, Pulse-Doppler Single Target Track and two auto acquisition modes are present - Boresight and Vertical. Depending on the radar mode you can further alter its settings - azimuth width, number of bars and range. Did I mention you could interact with the cockpit by means of your mouse? Yes, the cockpit is clickable and switches are animated!

So how is the combat - well, since F-14 role was mainly Fleet Defense (at that time), we will be dealing with shooting down aircraft and cruise missiles mostly. Missions will range from CAP sorties, to escort flights, fleet defence, intercepts etc. Available weapons are usual suspects - IR guided AIM-9 Sidewinders, semi-active homing AIM-7 Sparrows and highly advanced long range active radar homing AIM-54 Phoenix missiles each costing taxpayers a round million dollars so don't waste them. For the "too close for missiles, switching to guns" scenarios you have your trusty M-61 Vulcan 20mm gatling gun. Even though there is no mud moving on our part, the diversity of the mission types and presented tactical situations keeps the gameplay interesting throughout.

The last aspect I would like to touch upon was the wingman control. In each combat mission you were a part of a 2-ship. You were always the lead. The key to success was to efficiently use your wingman - he or she always carried the same missile load as you, so even when faced with superior numbers you could still reign hell with 12 Phoenix missiles, assuming you selected the "Fleet Defense BRAVO" loadout with 6 AIM-54s. In close quarters your wingman could watch your six, or you could send him/her to sanitize a specific area to widen your search.

All of this sounds great, but are there any shortcomings? To be honest, not many. The only thing I would add would be aerial refueling. It is a significant part of naval aviation and it's unfortunate it wasn't implemented. Also the lack of multiplayer features was a let down. Other than that, personally I consider the Fleet Defender as the best depiction of F-14 Tomcat in a flight sim, surpassed only by Heatblur's F-14 for DCS, but only in flight and systems modelling as the overall "atmosphere" in DCS World is still a bit lacking.

### Addons / Patches
#### 1.2 Patch
Fixed numerous bugs of the initial 1.0 release. Most notably - heading drift, padlock jitters, disappearing missiles and much more. Interestingly in the initial version of the game when you started your mission you had your radar and master arm turned off, which was pretty realistic, you had to activate them manually, which was usually done after take off / after fenced-in. In 2.0 version both radar and master arm were already activated possibily to not confuse players why their sensors and weapons doesn't work.

#### Fleet Defender: Scenario
This expansion for Fleet Defender updates the game to 2.0 version with more bug fixes (fix for faster machines), adds the Indian Ocean and Korean Peninsula maps with six campaigns, US Pacific Fleet F-14 squadrons and a mission builder. The mission builder was a powerful tool - the same that the developers used for creating the missions in the game.

#### Fleet Defender Gold
This CD release combined the base game with the Scenario expansion and added multimedia presentations, which includes interactive tutorials explaining every aspect of the F-14 Tomcat, several communication and video recordings of actual aerial confrontations, a glossary, and Aviation Week's "Flight Deck" video documentary which showcases operations aboard naval carriers (also included are six "teaser" promos of other Aviation Week videos).

### 3rd party tools and addons
30 years after the game release PixelWings created few mods for Fleet Defender: 
* Ship Upgrade Pack - improved textures and models for several US and Soviet vessels
* Aircraft Upgrade Teaser - improved 3d mesh and textures for F-16, F-4, MiG-21 and B-52.
* Ocean Upgrade - new water texture and disabled the "treadmill" effect

## Quotes and Triva
* PC Gamer praised the game for its graphics and sound, flexibility in setting the realism options making the game as easy or hard as you liked. Giving it an overall score of 88%.

* Computer Gaming World similarly stated that you can tailor it to the casual or hard-core gamer, and that it's more of a tactical flight sim where you spend more time in the back seat than dogfighting. They praised the quality and AI, but were disappointed by the lack of modem options. Summing it up "... even as a solo flight, Fleet Defender is an outstanding simulator that will serve to reestablish MicroProse as a major player in the flight sim wars."

* There are some silly Easter Eggs in the form of curious objects you can find flying during your training and campaign sorties, like dragons, UFOs, lost Avenger flight (Flight 19) and Bill Stealey's T-28 Trojan
