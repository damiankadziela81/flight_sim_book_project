# Back to Baghdad

The intro video begins with a pseudo metal soundtrack and an F-16 landing at an airbase as troops cheer its arrival. It continues with speeches by President G.W. Bush and General Schwarzkopf about the liberation of Kuwait and the downfall of Saddam Hussein. The intro concludes with lyrics, “Going back to Baghdad. Gonna kick some ass… I’m gonna get myself an F-16 and turn your desert into glass!” hinting that the sim had a Nuclear Option. 

Released in 1996, Back to Baghdad (B2B) was a ‘hard-core’ F-16 simulation that placed pilots in a hypothetical scenario where Saddam Hussein returned to power after the US won the Gulf War. You were then tasked to return "Back to Baghdad" to destroy his regime. The publisher Military Simulations, Inc. (MSI), marketed B2B as the most realistic F-16 simulation available on PC. The sim’s announced retail cost of $99.99 created a stir among gamers in the flight sim genre because most games averaged around $50. MSI was also an unknown contender in a market already populated with popular sims from publishers like Spectrum Holobyte, Dynamix, and MicroProse.  I was able to pick up a copy from my local Electronics Boutique for around $60.

B2B modeled the F-16C's avionics and flight model extremely well.  The FM used a 6 DoF (degree of freedom) model. It bled speed and handled as good as its real-life counterpart within the limitations of available PC computing power. MSI modelled the APG-68 radar at a level of complexity unseen in existing sims at the time. MFD pages included several sub modes, sensor of interest, and other features found in the real aircraft. A special feature, developed by MSI, was support for an extra monochrome monitor to display the APG-68 radar display modes. If users had a Hercules or equivalent card, they could enjoy this feature. I had an extra amber monitor and graphics card and was happy to test out the feature which worked flawlessly and showcased the APG-68s capabilities. The radar was complex to the point that some simmers complained it was broken because they were unable to lock up aircraft in visual range and within the scan cone.  It turned out that they had to manage the radar similar to real pilots. Others complained that the flight model was broken because it was not possible to turn and burn indefinitely as in other sims. Real life pilots, like Buzz Hoffman, commented that the model was as close to the real thing as they’ve ever experienced. 

While the B2B rendered the F-16’s cockpit beautifully, the view system was simplistic. It was limited to front, back, up, down, left, right, and an external view.  The padlock implementation contained a floating box that displayed enemy aircraft that got outside the pilot’s forward view. It showed the relative location by floating around the screen, as well as the aspect of the enemy. Like the radar, the system took some practice for pilots to get comfortable. 

MSI modeled most of the F-16s air-to-air and air-to-ground arsenal, giving pilots access to a plethora of weapons. Remember that reference about turning the “desert into glass?” B2B allowed pilots to deploy the B-61 tactical nuke. Delivering this bomb required a specific profile and any mistiming resulted in severe damage or the destruction of your aircraft. On more than one occasion, I broke my airframe. Interestingly, there were no other significant consequences, beyond destruction, for delivering the tac nuke. 

The terrain was software rendered and featured sparce cities, airfields, and the sort. Because pilots flew over the desert there was not much to see. Things got interesting when approaching an ingress point and the enemy opened up with AAA and SAMs. Pilots could fly over 40 missions in the skies over the Gulf. Sadly, B2B did not have wingmen so there were no comms or other pilot interactions. Most sorties started in the air but pilots had the option of landing after each sortie. The sim did have a decent soundscape, which included the jet, weapons, explosions, and the sort.

The manual that came with the sim was only around 77 pages extremely inadequate due to the complexity of the sim and modeled systems. After a public outcry, MSI commissioned Tom “KC” Basham to rewrite it. He delivered a 190+ page, spiral-bound manual that was well written. It even included an entire chapter dedicated to the APG-68. 

Regarding hardware support, MSI had a partnership with Thrustmaster so the sim supported the F-16 FLCS, TQS, and rudders by default. TM owners enjoyed a true HOTAS experience. It also worked with CH Product’s sticks and rudder.

B2B was marketed as hardcore for a reason. It had a steep learning curve and did not offer gameplay features found in other popular sims of the day. Still, once you became able to effectively fly the Viper and delivery ordnance it offered a satisfying experience of commanding the jet. Still, sim pilots either loved or hated the sim complexity and gameplay elements. Interestingly, MSI had plans for its successor but abandoned the project because it landed a lucrative military project to model the radar for the Air Force F-16 simulators. George Keverian, lead designer and director, mentioned that developing a simulator was not a lucrative endeavor so, we’ll never know if a sequel hit the marks simmers expected.

NOTES: I sourced most of the images from MSIs old website trough wayback machine: https://web.archive.org/web/19970407152622/http://www.military-sim.com/b2binfo.htm

I had over four pages of content but was able to trim it back to two pages. Feel free to make any adjustments you want to make it fit with the style of the project.
