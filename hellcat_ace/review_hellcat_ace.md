# Hellcat Ace

## Review
“I can do this myself and better on my home computer in a week!”
These were the words of Sid Meier to Bill Stealey after the two, along with other participants of a business meeting, played a round on a “Red Baron” arcade machine during a lunch break in Las Vegas. If Sid could actually pull this off, Bill would take care of the sales. 

Although it took Meier nearly two months, in the end, the first flight simulation of the newly founded company MicroProse was born: “Hellcat Ace.”

Hellcat Ace puts the player in the role of a pilot in the Pacific theater during World War II. 
In various aircraft types, ranging from a P-40 Tomahawk over a F4F Wildcat to a P-38 Lightning, the player can choose between 14 missions.
The missions cover the most important stages of the war against the Japanese Empire. Pearl Harbor, Wake Island, Coral Sea, Midway, Guadalcanal, the Battle of Leyte Gulf, and finally the capture of Iwo Jima. Everything known from history books is available as a mission. There’s even a special mission where the player must shoot down Japanese Admiral Yamamoto.
What sounds like an extensive simulation of the air war in the Pacific turns out to be relatively simple missions when actually played. 
Essentially, the missions differ only in that some take place at night (moon) or during the day (sun). Additionally, the behaviour of enemy aircraft changes depending on whether you’re fighting a transport plane or a Zero fighter. 
Graphic wise, there are no differences in the depiction of the enemy aircraft.

The cockpit displays basic information such as altitude, speed, direction, remaining gun ammunition, and thrust settings. The view from the cockpit shows only a horizon line, with the sky above and water below. 
The actual flight model is very basic but not to bad, considering we are dealing with 8-bit systems from 1982. The combination of thrust and joystick input provides a surprisingly good flight experience. Even features like stall were considered.
In a later version from 1984, the graphics were improved so that you could now see the frame of the cockpit and the standard font of the C64 was no longer used.

The goal of the game is to win each of the 14 missions (in various difficulty levels) and shoot down at least five enemy planes to achieve “Ace” status. If a mission doesn’t go well, you can bail out with a parachute or try to ditch your plane in the water. Either you’ll be picked up by a friendly submarine or, in the worst case, end up as a prisoner of war.

For a debut product from a young company, Hellcat Ace was and still is a game MicroProse can be proud of. The Atari Antic magazine praised Hellcat Ace at the time: “While the graphics could be improved, the playability of the game is not harmed by this, and I recommend it to those of you with dreams of glory and the big blue yonder.”
