# Hellcat Ace

## Review
“I can do this myself and even better on my home computer in a week!”
These were the words of Sid Meier to Bill Stealey after the two, along with other participants of a business meeting, played a round on a “Red Baron” arcade machine during a lunch break in Las Vegas. If Sid could actually pull this off, Bill would take care of the sales. 

Although it took Meier nearly two months, in the end, the first flight simulation of their newly founded company MicroProse was born: “Hellcat Ace”.

Hellcat Ace puts the player in the role of a pilot in the Pacific theater during World War II. 
In various aircraft types, ranging from a P-40 Tomahawk over a F4F Wildcat to a P-38 Lightning, the player can choose between 14 missions.
The missions cover the most important stages of the war against the Japanese Empire. Pearl Harbor, Wake Island, Coral Sea, Midway, Guadalcanal, the Battle of Leyte Gulf, and finally the capture of Iwo Jima. Everything known from history books is available as a mission. There’s even a special mission where the player must shoot down Japanese Admiral Yamamoto.

What sounds like an extensive simulation of the air war in the Pacific turns out to be relatively simple missions when actually played. 
Essentially, the missions differ only in that some take place at night (moon) or during the day (sun). Additionally, the behaviour of enemy aircraft changes depending on whether you’re fighting a transport plane or a Zero fighter. 
Graphic wise, there are no differences in the depiction of the enemy aircraft.

The cockpit displays basic information such as altitude, speed, heading, remaining gun ammunition, and throttle settings. There is even a rearview mirror in which you can spot enemy aircraft approaching from behind. The simulated world actually consists of only a line symbolizing the horizon. The sky is depicted in blue, and the ground in green.

The actual flight model is very basic but not too bad, considering we are dealing with 8-bit systems from 1982. The combination of thrust and joystick input provides a surprisingly good flight experience. Even features like stall were considered. All basic combat maneuvers such as the Barrel Roll, Split-S, or Immelmann can be used to engage opponents.

Initially released for the 8-bit systems of Atari in 1982, a version for the Commodore 64 followed in 1983. In 1984 a DOS version for IBM-compatible PCs followed as well.
In an updated version for the Atari and Commodore from 1984, the graphics were improved.

The goal of the game is to win each of the 14 missions (in various difficulty levels) and shoot down at least five enemy planes to achieve “Ace” status. If a mission doesn’t go well, you can bail out with a parachute or try to ditch your plane in the water. Either you’ll be picked up by a friendly submarine or, in the worst case, end up as a prisoner of war.
All combat is air-to-air only. No bombing, no support for the ground or what so ever.

Hellcat Ace was a commercial success and received positive reviews from both players and critics. It was praised for its realistic gameplay, detailed graphics, and challenging missions. The success of Hellcat Ace helped establish MicroProse as a leading developer of simulation games and paved the way for future titles.
