# MiG Alley Ace
“MiG Alley” was a roughly 150 km long strip of land in northwestern Korea, stretching along the Yalu River at the Korean/Chinese border. The area was the scene of countless dogfights between US F-86 Sabre aircraft and North Korean MiG-15s.

MiG-Alley Ace seamlessly follows its predecessors Hellcat Ace and Spitfire Ace. Developed by Andy Hollis, the game puts the player in the role of a combat pilot during the Korean War, fighting against enemy MiG-15 jets in the infamous “MiG Alley.” A series of missions, all with a historical background, are available.

The biggest innovation is the multiplayer component. Pilots can now choose to fight alone, together against the computer, or head-to-head against each other. Up to four aircraft can be in the air at any one time.

The game offers a split-screen view, allowing two players to compete against each other simultaneously. This feature was particularly innovative for its time and contributed to the game’s popularity.
