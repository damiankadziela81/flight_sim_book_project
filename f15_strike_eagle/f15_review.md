# F-15 Strike Eagle
"Having dispatched a MiG-21 over Syrian territory with a Short-Ranged Attack Missile(SRAM), I continue flying toward my primary target — Syrian Air Command Headquarters. Radar picks up four surface-to-air missiles (SAMS), and two enemy aircraft on an intercept course. Arming a medium ranged missile (MRM), I fire at the first aircraft. Turning my attention to the four SAMS, I dispatch two flares and engage electronic counter measures (ECM). Two missiles disappear from my radar display. A third explodes on a flare. I watch as my missile impacts the first aircraft and my computer display flashes the message,
"Enemy Plane Hit". The target is rapidly approaching. Arming bombs, I dive toward my target ignoring the last enemy aircraft and SAM. Dropping the bombs, I pull up and see on my computer display that the target is hit. I immediately turn to line up a secondary target, WHAM! WHAM! I'm hit by the last
SAM and an enemy SRAM from the last enemy aircraft pulling up out of the wild dive, I'm treated with a hail of cannon fire from the enemy aircraft. Too low to bail out, my mission ends as I slam into the ground!!"

In such vivid and graphic detail, Hosea Battles, Jr. describes a mission over Syria in MicroProse’s latest flight simulator, "F-15 Strike Eagle" in Computer Gaming World's December issue of 1984).

The game offered a variety of missions set in different geopolitical hotspots, such as Libya, the Persian Gulf, and Vietnam. 
For the first time in a MicroProse flightsim, players could engage in both air-to-air and air-to-ground combat, using a variety of weapons including short and medium ranged air-to-air missiles, bombs and the F-15’s onboard cannon. 
Also featured were electronic countermeasures, chaffs and flares to evade enemy missiles, adding a layer of strategy to the fast-paced action.

When F-15 Strike Eagle was released in 1985, it represented a significant leap forward in graphical quality. Some of these improvements saw their introduction in MicrProse civilian flightsim "Solo Flight". Gone were the days of simple horizon line-only landscape graphics with one sprite for the enemy.

Cockpit View: 
The game featured a detailed cockpit view with various instruments and a heads-up display (HUD). This was a step up from the more abstract representations in earlier games.

While still relatively simple by today’s standards, the terrain in F-15 Strike Eagle was more detailed and varied. Players could distinguish between different types of terrain, such as deserts and oceans. Enemy aircraft were no longer represented with sprites but with vector graphics. However, ground targets were merely symbolized as a large triangle on the ground.

The game made better use of the limited color palettes available on early home computers. This resulted in more visually appealing and varied environments.

For the first time in a MicroProse title, a copy protection system was used. The 36-page manual contains 15 numerical codes, each associated with a letter. At the start of a mission, one of the “secret F-15 Authorization Codes” was requested. If the wrong code was entered, important aircraft systems were not available during the game.

F-15 was ported to a wide range of systems (C64, Atari, MSX, DOS, PC-88/98, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Apple II, ZX Spectrum). At the beginning of the 90s versions for Game Gear and the NES were published. Even a version for the handheld Gameboy was released.

In 1991, MicroProse attempted to bring F-15 Strike Eagle to the arcade market. The arcade version featured enhanced graphics and sound, thanks to the more powerful hardware available in arcade cabinets. However, despite these improvements, the arcade version failed to capture the same level of success as its home computer counterparts.

Also worth mentioning is the manual that comes in the box. While an eight-page booklet suffices for Hellcat Ace, F-15 Strike Eagle already boasts a substantial 40 pages manual. Besides the operation of the computer simulation, the manual also offers a wealth of background information for the first time. From the theory of flying, basics of air combat, detailed information on the weapons used, enemy forces, and a description of the mission scenarios, the manual provides a good overview of the simulation topic. Even today, many decades after its release, one still enjoys picking up the manual and browsing through it.

* the first edition of the manual forgot to mention on how to land the plane (fly slowly under 1000ft over your Homebase)
