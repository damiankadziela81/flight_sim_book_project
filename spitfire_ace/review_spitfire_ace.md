# Spitfire Ace
After the release of Hellcat Ace, MicroProse quickly followed up with a second variant of the game set in the European theater of war. In all essential aspects, it is the same game as Hellcat Ace. The missions (nine to choose from) this time range from the Battle of Dunkirk, through the period of the Battle of Britain, to D-Day and finally the end of the Third Reich. The difficulty level ranges from very simple missions, such as shooting down a German bomber, to really tough air battles against the first German jet fighter, the Me-262. According to the mission description, you no longer fly different aircraft, but only the eponymous Spitfire. 
As in the predecessor, there are no takeoffs or landings, no ground targets, no weather, or other aspects one would expect from a flight simulation.

Spitfire Ace was developed for the Atari 8-bit computers and later ported to the Commodore 64 and IBM PC compatibles.

In his memoirs published in 2020, Sid Meier suggests that Spitfire Ace would probably be marketed as an add-on today.

# Trivia\
* If you loose a misson, "Lili Marlen" is played. In success "God save the King"
* "The game saves high scores, but be sure you don't purchase a copy that is write-protected unless you are prepared to cut your own notch in the disk envelope. MicroProse wasn't able to get unprotected disks from its copier. A write-protected disk won't stop execution of the program when it tries unsuccessfully to save a score, but it will make your disk drive light blink, Who can concentrate on shooting down Messerschmitts with that kind of distraction?" (Softline April 1984)
* Spitfire Ace places players in the cockpit of the legendary Supermarine Spitfire, a key aircraft in the Royal Air Force’s defense against the German Luftwaffe. 

## Mission Examples
