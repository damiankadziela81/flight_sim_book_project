# Spitfire Ace
After the release of Hellcat Ace, MicroProse quickly followed up with a second version set in the European theater of war. In all essential aspects, it is the same game as Hellcat Ace. The missions this time range from the Battle of Dunkirk, through the period of the Battle of Britain, to D-Day and finally the end of the Third Reich. According to the mission description, you no longer fly different aircraft, but only the eponymous Spitfire. In his memoirs published in 2020, Sid Meier suggests that Spitfire Ace would probably be marketed as an add-on today.
