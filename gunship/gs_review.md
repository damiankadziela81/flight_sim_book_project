# Gunship
Gunship is the MicroProse simulation that will always have a special place in my heart because it was the first game on the C64 that I actually bought. In the mid-80s, it was not uncommon to get most of your games through trading in the schoolyard. I had already played F-15 Strike Eagle with great enthusiasm, and then the first reviews and advertisements for Gunship appeared in the gaming magazines.

Andy Hollis and Arnold Hendrick began considering a helicopter simulation right after Solo Flight and F-15 demonstrated a market for flight simulations. Following some initial research in early 1985, work on Gunship commenced in the summer of '85.
The first draft focused on the Vietnam War-era Cobra helicopter. MicroProse president “Wild Bill” Stealey named it “Cobra Gunship.” The battlefield in this initial version was more urban, and the gameplay had an arcade-like feel. Around that time, a new helicopter, the Hughes AH-64A Apache, entered production.
Being a more modern and technologically sophisticated helicopter, the team at MicroProse soon shifted their focus to the AH-64A and decided to create a simulation based on it. Originally slated for a fall 1985 release, the date was postponed and eventually dropped. Meanwhile, Sid Meier developed a new 3D engine on one of the new Amiga machines, and everyone at MicroProse was convinced this was the way forward.
By then, MicroProse had already invested significant time and money into the project, but their goal was to produce quality software rather than make a quick profit. Work continued, and Meier’s 3D engine was ported to the 8-bit systems. Concurrently, Arnold Hendrick conducted extensive research on the new helicopter. Although much of the information was still classified, advertisements and unclassified data provided enough for MicroProse.
Michael Haire, the graphic artist, worked on the cockpit design and all the award, arming, and options screens. In October 1986, Gunship was released, 18 months after its initial announcement. When I mail-ordered my copy in 1986, I was still in school. It was the first “real” simulation I played, and I was hooked from the first moment.
The manual taught me the basics I needed to know about the virtual battlefield for upcoming sims. I remember thinking, “This is perfect. It couldn’t be better.” As it turned out, I had no idea what was yet to come.
